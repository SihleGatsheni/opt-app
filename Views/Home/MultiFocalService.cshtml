                <h3>All You Need To Know  About Multifocals!</h3>
                <p>Multifocal, or progressive lenses, have multiple focusing powers. This improves your vision at different distances.</p>

                <p>Progressive lenses are appropriate when someone has multiple vision problems. Bifocals and trifocals have sharp lines between the different sections. </p>

                <p>Both sets of people can opt for either having the multifocal lenses or having two or more pairs of single-vision glasses to correct more than one type of vision.</p>

                <p>In multifocal, the different sections of focusing power are blended together. In most cases, they have a prescription for nearsightedness, farsightedness, and intermediate distances.</p>

                <p>Multifocal lenses correct age-related vision problems. They offer a gradual or progressive switch between farsightedness and nearsightedness correction. They also make it so you don’t need to switch glasses based on what you’re doing.</p>
